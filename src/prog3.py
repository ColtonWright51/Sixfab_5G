Communicates to the Quectel RM502Q-AE modem through a serial port. The modem
uses the standard "Hayes command set" popular with modems. Attempt to read
some broadband data through the modem without actually connecting to a tower.
This is done with the "Network Service Commands" given in the modem's
documentation.
